# Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds

## Overview

The project includes creating a Python application that utilizes a pre-trained image classifier to identify dog breeds. The application is designed to train an image classifier on a dataset and predict labels for new images using the trained model.
We utilize three well-known CNN architectures: AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet. The goal is to determine which architecture performs best in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Dataset

The project uses a large dataset of images called ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images.

## Results

VGG Achieved 100% accuracy in identifying dog images and had the best performance in classifying dog breeds.

VGG is the best model for our objectives, despite its higher computational cost.
